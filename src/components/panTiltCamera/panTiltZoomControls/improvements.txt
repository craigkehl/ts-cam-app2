Use types instead of any: The touchHandler function currently takes an argument of type any, which is not recommended. You should specify the type of the TouchEvent instead, like this: (e: TouchEvent) => void.

Use the useReducer hook: The useState hook is used multiple times to update the rate state. This can be simplified by using the useReducer hook instead.

Extract logic into separate functions: The translateCoordinates and handleMouseMove functions contain logic that can be extracted into separate functions. This can make the code more modular and easier to understand.

Use the useLayoutEffect hook: The useEffect hook is used to update the rate state, but it runs after the component has rendered, which can cause flickering. Instead, you can use the useLayoutEffect hook, which runs before the component is rendered.

Use TypeScript utility types: TypeScript provides utility types that can make the code more readable and maintainable. For example, you can use Partial to make some of the properties of an object optional, and Omit to remove properties from an object.
